Outline
- What is a core dump?
- System 6
- Crash(8)
If the reason for the crash is not evident
(see below for guidance on `evident')
you may want to try to dump the system if you feel up to
debugging.
At the moment a dump can be taken only on magtape.
With a tape mounted and ready,
stop the machine, load address 44, and start.
This should write a copy of all of core
on the tape with an EOF mark.

- 3BSD
added to crash(8) in 3BSD: (Someday the LSI-11 will do this automatically.)

# * Introduction

# Crash dumps, also known as core dumps, have been a part of BSD since it's
# beginning. A core dump is ``a copy of memory that is saved on secondary storage
# by the kernel''^[1] for debugging a system failure. Though 36 years have passed
# since =doadump= came about in 3BSD, core dumps are still created and utilized in
# much the same way they were then. In addition a call to action will be made for
# modularizing the core dump code.

* Introduction

The BSD core dump facility performs a simple yet vital service to the operator:
preserving a copy of the contents of system memory at the time of a fatal error,
or =panic(9)=. This copy can represent a machine readable dump of the contents of system
memory, a subset of those kernel pages that are active at the time of the crash, or a
less complete but human readable form using debugger scripting.

The FreeBSD variant of the BSD operating system has introduced gradual
extensions to the core dumping facility in the form of, ``minidumps'' that only
represent active kernel memory, ``textdumps(4)'' consisting of the result of debugger
scripting at the time of panic, encrypted dumps, compressed dumps and the
ability to dump to a remote network device. While promising, these extensions
have been inconsistent in their integration and interoperability.

# (And if we're
# lucky, some news about dump procedures relating to hibernation and virtual
# machine migration!)

This paper will provide a historical survey of the dump facility itself, these
dump extensions, and describe an active effort to fully modularize them, allowing
the operator to enable one or more of them simultaneously. It will also address
related utilities to determine the size of a dump in advance and kernel debugger
(DDB) scripting options.


* Motivation

Though core dumps were originally made to magnetic tape, dumps
have been made to a swap partition on a hard disk since at least 3BSD.
For decades since, increases in physical system memory and swap partition size have
loosely tracked increases in available persistent memory, allowing for the
continued use of this paradigm. 

# Since 4.1BSD, an
# operator would allocate a region on disk to a ``dumpdev'' that is equal to
# physical system memory plus a small buffer. 

However, recent advances in commodity system hardware have upended the
traditional memory to disk space ratio with systems now routinely utilizing 1TB
or more physical memory whilst running on relatively small solid state disks.
Given that the kernel memory footprint has grown in size, the assumption that
disk space would always allow for a swap partition large enough for a core dump
has proved to be inaccurate. This change has spurred development of
several extensions to the core dumping facility, including compressed dumping
and dumping over the network to a server with disk space for modern core dumps.
Network Dumping, or =netdump= does have some security implications which recent
work on encrypted dumping may resolve.

* Background
  # - Canonical BSD Unix core memory dumping: All memory to a
  #      pre-designated device
  #   - 64kb indent, starts dumping at END of dump dev in case you
  #        start swapping early in boot before you retrieve the dump.
  #        4.2BSD?
  #   - kern/kern\_shutdown.c (Traditional)

  #   - Backtrace.io paper here

When a UNIX-like system such as FreeBSD encounters an unrecoverable and
unexpected error the kernel will "panic". Though the word panic has connotations
of irrationality, the function =panic(9)= maintains composure while it
"[terminates] the running system" and "[attempts] to save a core dump" to a
configured dump device. [2] Core dumps, sometimes known as crash dumps are
used to debug system failures. Crash dumps are "a copy of memory that is saved
on secondary storage by the kernel when a catastrophic failure occurs." [1]
What follows is a thorough description of the FreeBSD core dump routine starting
with =doadump()= in =sys/kern/kern_shutdown.c=. The FreeBSD operating system
source code can be checked out using subversion by following the FreeBSD
handbook instructions [3].


=doadump()= is called by =kern_reboot()=, which shutsdown "the system cleanly to
prepare for reboot, halt, or power off." [4] =kern_reboot()= calls
=doadump()= if the =RB_DUMP= flag is set and the system is not "cold" or already
creating a core dump. =doadump()= takes a boolean informing it to whether or not
to take a "text dump", a form of dump carried out if the online kernel debugger,
=DDB=, is built into the running kernel. =doaddump()= returns an error code if
the system is currently creating a dump, the dumper is NULL and returns error
codes on behalf of =dumpsys()=.

=doadump(boolean_t textdump)= starts the core dump procedure by saving the
current context with a call to =savectx()= and then invokes a core dump using
=dumpsys()=, passing it a =struct dumper= and optionally a "text dump" which is
carried out if the online kernel debugger, =DDB=, is built into the running
kernel.

=dumpsys()= is defined on a per-architecture basis. This allows different
architectures to setup their dump structure differently. =dumpsys()= calls
=dumpsys_generic()= passing along the =struct dumperinfo= it was called with.
=dumpsys_generic()= is defined in =sys/kern/kern_dump.c= and is the meat of the
core dump procedure.

There are several main steps to the dumping procedure. The main steps are as
follows. At any point if there is an error condition, goto failure cleanup at
the end of the procedure.

1. Fill in the ELF header.
2. Calculate the dump size.
3. Determine if the dump device is large enough.
4. Begin Dump
   1. Leader (Padding)
   2. ELF Header
   3. Program Headers
   4. Memory Chunks
   5. Trailer
5. End Dump

* History

** Core Dumps in BSD

The following is a quick history of core dumps in the BSD operating systems
tracing from before the advent of =doadump= in 3BSD through to the present and a
discussion of current work on compressed dumps, dumping over the network and
encrypted dumps.

Core dumping was initially a manual process as documented in Version 6 AT&T
UNIX's =crash(8)=, an operator, ``if [they felt] up to debugging'' would:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
With a tape mounted and ready,
stop the machine, load address 44, and start.
#+END_QUOTE

Providing the operator with a core dump on tape to debug a crashed system.

As of 3BSD and with the advent of the LSI-11 core dumping has been automated via
=doadump= ^[2], the same function name used today. =doadump= was added to 3BSD
in 1980 by Ozalp Babaoglu and was written in 33 lines of PDP-11 assembly.

# TODO check this PDP-11 assembly assertion

Beginning in 4.1BSD =doadump= was re-written in C for the VAX and placed in
=sys/vax/vax/machdep.c=.

# TODO Talk here about added architectures? Pretty much everything is the same
# from here on out just added architectures
